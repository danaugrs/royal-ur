Royal Ur is my 3D implementation of the ancient [Royal Game of Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur) played around 4500 years ago in Mesopotamia. It was built with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

I tried to go for a very clean and universal design, without using text at all. I was inspired to create this game after watching the following great video:

## Objective

Run all your pieces through the course and out before your opponent.

## Rules

Piece movements are determined by rolling four pyramid-shaped dice. Two of the four corners of each die are marked, giving each die a 50% chance of landing with a marked or unmarked corner facing up.
After rolling, the total number of marked ends facing upwards indicates how many spaces a player may move during that turn.

Players are required to move a piece whenever possible, even if it results in an unfavorable outcome.
Rolling a zero will automatically skip your turn. Sometimes it is impossible to move the indicated amount of spaces and the turn is also automatically skipped.

If a player lands a piece on a space already occupied by one of their opponent's pieces, the opponent's piece is captured and sent back to the beginning, off the board.

The spaces that have a mandala are special. Landing in one of them will grant a second roll of the dice. In addition, pieces on mandala spaces can't be captured.

To exit a piece off the board at the end of the course the player must roll the exact number of spaces remaining plus one.

## Support

I hope you enjoy playing and learning from Royal Ur as much as I enjoyed making it.
